When you run the EnableInPlaceArchive.ps1 script, it prompts you to log in to Exchange Online with your M365 Admin account.

In the script, you must specify the Display Name of the user you want to activate the archive feature. The script activates the user's online archive feature to move e-mails older than one year into the archive.

If you want, you can change the number of days for the items to be moved to the archive in the Retention Tag section.
