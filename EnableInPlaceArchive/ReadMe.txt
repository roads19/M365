When you run the EnableInPlaceArchive.ps1 script, it prompts you to log in to Exchange Online with your M365 Administrator account.

After that, you must specify the mailbox for which you want to enable the archive feature.

Finally, you must enter the number of days the items will be moved to the archive.

Next, the script enables the user's online archive and it moves items to archive according to the retention policy you specified.
